# Smart-Attendance-App V1.0

The app captures face details and personal information of the user. 

On the basis of whether the face of the employee/user matches with the data present in our database or not, the smart attendance app will mark the attendance of the employee.

The attributes compared while matching data with the database are: face image, location, time etc.
